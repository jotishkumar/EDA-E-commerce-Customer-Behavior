# E-commerce-Customer-Behavior-EDA

This repository features my project analyzing customer behavior in e-commerce. The goal is to understand how various factors such as demographics, spending habits, membership types, satisfaction levels, and the impact of discounts influence customer spending and overall satisfaction.

## Analysis Performed

1. **Handling Missing Values**: 
   - Identified and dealt with any missing data in the dataset, ensuring data integrity for analysis.

2. **Duplicates**: 
   - Checked for and removed any duplicate records to maintain a clean dataset.

3. **Conditional Filtering**:
   - Analyzed the number of customers with Gold membership.
   - Filtered customers who spent more than $1,000.
   - Identified customers from New York who applied a discount.

4. **Membership Spending Analysis**: 
   - Investigated which membership type shows the highest total spending through group-by operations and visualizations.

5. **Satisfaction and Spending Correlation**: 
   - Explored how customer satisfaction impacts total spending across different membership types.

6. **Discounts and Ratings**: 
   - Analyzed the average rating for customers who applied discounts and assessed if membership type affects these ratings.

7. **Days Since Last Purchase**: 
   - Evaluated the impact of days since the last purchase on customer satisfaction levels.
